# Python Programming Assignments

This repositry contains the python versions of the programming assignments for the [Machine Learning online class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) taught by Professor Andrew Ng. 

Completed the course to improve knowledge about machine learning. <br />
Decided to complete the course assignments in Python rather than Octave. <br />

All credit for the conversion of the assignments from Octave to Python goes to [Gerges Dib](https://github.com/dibgerge).

These assignments work seamlessly with the class and do not require any of the materials published in the MATLAB assignments. Here are some new and useful features for these sets of assignments: 

- The assignments use [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html), which provides an intuitive flow easier than the original MATLAB/OCTAVE assignments.
- The original assignment instructions have been completely re-written and the parts which used to reference MATLAB/OCTAVE functionality have been changed to reference its `python` counterpart.
- The re-written instructions are now embedded within the Jupyter Notebook along with the `python` starter code. For each assignment, all work is done solely within the notebook.
- The `python` assignments can be submitted for grading. They were tested to work perfectly well with the original Coursera grader that is currently used to grade the MATLAB/OCTAVE versions of the assignments. 
- After each part of a given assignment, the Jupyter Notebook contains a cell which prompts the user for submitting the current part of the assignment for grading.   

Each assignment is contained in a separate folder. For example, assignment 1 is contained within the folder `Exercise1`. Each folder contains two files: 
 - The assignment `jupyter` notebook, which has a `.ipynb` extension.
 - A python module `utils.py` which contains some helper functions needed for the assignment. Functions within the `utils` module are called from the python notebook. You do not need to modify or add any code to this file.
 
Note* Some files have a exercise.py file which contains the jupyter code transferred over. <br />
I've done this to be able to code in a debugging environment.
